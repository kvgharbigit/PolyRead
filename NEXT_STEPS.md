## 3. Critical Integration Tasks (Priority Order)

**Immediate Tasks to Make App Functional:**

1. **Phase 0 Validation (URGENT - All marked as incomplete):**
   - [ ] **PDF Text Extraction**: Replace placeholder with real `pdfx` implementation (currently fails)
   - [ ] **EPUB Text Selection**: Implement actual text selection in `epub_view` (marked as TODO)
   - [ ] **ML Kit Translation**: Device testing and model validation (code exists, untested)
   - [ ] **SQLite Performance**: Load actual dictionary data and test <10ms lookup times

2. **Core Integration Tasks:**
   - [ ] **Dictionary Data Population**: Load Wiktionary data into SQLite database
   - [ ] **Reader-Translation Pipeline**: Connect text selection to translation services
   - [ ] **Language Pack Integration**: Connect pack downloads to dictionary/translation services
   - [ ] **ML Kit Model Integration**: Connect language packs to ML Kit model downloads

3. **Advanced Feature Integration:**
   - [ ] **TTS-Reader Integration**: Connect TTS highlighting to reader engines
   - [ ] **Vocabulary-Reader Integration**: Connect word selection to vocabulary creation
   - [ ] **Performance Harness Integration**: Make testing tools accessible from main UI

## 4. Phase 1 Implementation (After Phase 0 Gates Pass)

**Foundation Architecture (Weeks 2-3):**

### Week 2 Tasks:
```bash
# Core Services Implementation
lib/core/
├── database/app_database.dart         # Main SQLite setup
├── services/settings_service.dart     # User preferences  
├── services/file_service.dart         # File operations
└── utils/constants.dart               # App constants
```

### Week 3 Tasks:
```bash
# Riverpod Providers Setup
lib/providers/
├── database_provider.dart    # Database access
├── settings_provider.dart    # Settings state
└── navigation_provider.dart  # Navigation state
```

## 5. Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development server
flutter run --hot

# Run tests continuously  
flutter test --watch

# Code quality checks
flutter analyze
dart format lib/ test/
```

### Before Each Phase
```bash
# Run full test suite
flutter test

# Performance check
flutter run --profile

# Build verification
flutter build apk --debug  # Android
flutter build ios --debug  # iOS
```

## 6. Risk Mitigation Plan

### If Phase 0 Validations Fail:

**PDF Issues**: 
- Fallback to manual OCR with ML Kit
- Consider WebView + PDF.js approach

**ML Kit Issues**:
- Reduce model size requirements
- Add progressive loading
- Fallback to dictionary-only mode

**EPUB Issues**: 
- Custom WebView HTML renderer
- Simplified text-only view

**SQLite Issues**:
- Optimize database schema
- Reduce dictionary entry count
- Add query result caching

## 7. Realistic Timeline & Milestones

### **CRITICAL PATH (Next 1-2 weeks) - Make App Actually Work:**
- [ ] **Fix PDF Reader**: Replace placeholder text extraction with working `pdfx` implementation
- [ ] **Fix EPUB Reader**: Implement real text selection in epub_view widget
- [ ] **Test ML Kit**: Validate translation models work on actual device
- [ ] **Load Dictionary Data**: Populate SQLite with actual Wiktionary entries
- [ ] **Connect Pipeline**: Link text selection → dictionary lookup → translation → vocabulary

### **Integration Phase (Weeks 3-4) - Connect Existing Features:**
- [ ] **Language Pack Integration**: Connect downloads to translation services
- [ ] **Advanced Feature Integration**: Make TTS, vocabulary, performance harness accessible
- [ ] **UI Polish**: Connect advanced translation popup and settings to reader flow
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**: Full reading-to-vocabulary workflow

### **Polish Phase (Weeks 5-6) - Optimization:**
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Achieve target metrics (<10ms lookups, <300ms translation)
- [ ] **Device Testing**: Test on multiple Android/iOS devices
- [ ] **Bug Fixes**: Address integration issues and edge cases

## 8. Success Metrics

### Technical Targets:
- **Build Stability**: Zero native module issues
- **Performance**: 2x faster than PolyBook dictionary lookups  
- **Memory**: <150MB baseline, <300MB with translation models
- **Startup**: <2 seconds cold start

### User Experience:
- **First Translation**: <30 seconds from install
- **Offline**: 100% core features work without internet
- **Storage**: <50MB per language pair average

## 🎯 Current Status Summary

### **What We Have: Excellent Foundation (65% Complete)**
- ✅ **Sophisticated Architecture**: Well-designed services and providers
- ✅ **Advanced Features**: TTS, vocabulary SRS, performance testing, enhanced UI
- ✅ **Working Components**: HTML/TXT readers, language pack management, settings

### **What We Need: Critical Integration Work (35% Remaining)**
- ❌ **Core Reading Functions**: PDF/EPUB text extraction and selection
- ❌ **Data Population**: Dictionary entries and ML Kit model integration  
- ❌ **Pipeline Connections**: Text selection → translation → vocabulary workflow
- ❌ **Device Validation**: Real-world testing of translation and reading features

### **Realistic Assessment:**
This is a **well-architected foundation** with **sophisticated advanced features**, but needs **critical integration work** to become a functional reading app. The codebase shows excellent engineering but overestimated completion status.

**Next Action**: Focus on critical path items - make PDF/EPUB readers actually work, then connect the translation pipeline.

**Contact**: Continue tracking progress with realistic completion percentages based on actual functionality.
